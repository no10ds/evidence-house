First, a word from our sponsors
INSERT PM VIDEO
When we launched in January, we couldn't have predicted the rate at which Evidence House would capture imaginations.

We now have a thriving community of over 350 engineers, developers and analysts from across government, and growing fast.

Through our hackathons they have generated an incredible array of insights and solutions, with some highly promising ones being developed further as a result. And we’re just getting started.

The coming weeks will see us launch some hugely exciting events and provide secondment and L&D opportunities to our amazing community.

Congratulations to the winning teams of our March and May hackathons!
We were delighted to welcome both teams to Downing Street to present their projects to a range of senior stakeholders and Ministers, all of whom were impressed by the work they have done.
Collectively their work has the potential to: 
•	Save thousands of people a year from the financial ruin and heartbreak that fraud leaves in its wake, by providing an SMS service that detects dodgy URLs
•	Help expedite our asylum decision making process, ensuring we can uphold our duty to support people in dire need
