# Introduction
When we launched in January, we couldn't have predicted the speed at which Evidence House would capture imaginations and take on a life of its own. I could not be more proud of this program.
We now have a thriving community of more than 400 engineers, developers and analysts from across government, and the movement is growing fast. Our half day skills bootcamps have delivered free training in a range of topics including python coding and evaluation skills to 70 people in the past week alone!
Through our hackathons, Evidence Housers have already generated an array of fascinating insights and promising solutions. Many of those with practical
applications are being developed further for delivery into departments, with the expectation that they will have real world impact.
We’re just getting started. This summer will see us mobilise our community on an even larger scale, collaborate across sectors and provide secondment and L&D opportunities to colleagues in every corner of government. If you’re a Civil Servant and want to deliver impact at pace, upgrade your technical skills and take your career to the next level, join us today.

First, a word from our sponsors
INSERT PM VIDEO
When we launched in January, we couldn't have predicted the rate at which Evidence House would capture imaginations.

We now have a thriving community of over 350 engineers, developers and analysts from across government, and growing fast.

Through our hackathons they have generated an incredible array of insights and solutions, with some highly promising ones being developed further as a result. And we’re just getting started.

The coming weeks will see us launch some hugely exciting events and provide secondment and L&D opportunities to our amazing community.

Congratulations to the winning teams of our March and May hackathons!
We were delighted to welcome both teams to Downing Street to present their projects to a range of senior stakeholders and Ministers, all of whom were impressed by the work they have done.
Collectively their work has the potential to: 
•	Save thousands of people a year from the financial ruin and heartbreak that fraud leaves in its wake, by providing an SMS service that detects dodgy URLs
•	Help expedite our asylum decision making process, ensuring we can uphold our duty to support people in dire need
