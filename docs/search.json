This playbook is focused on data-driven, technical hackathons that aim to produce novel digital tools and prototypes, rather than non-technical events, such as those hosted by Policy Lab, which focus on ideation and systems thinking.\nThese hackathons should focus on bringing together data and expertise from within and across departments, linking together disparate datasets in novel ways to generate impactive insights or identify opportunities to improve government through technology and automation.\nThis playbook walks you through the key steps in running a hackathon. It is a set of guidelines/patterns that have proved effective, so feel free to vary according to your needs!"

    "text": "Identifying a Challenge\nHackathons are most impactive when thematically focused on a problem or challenge, enabling participants to create their own innovative solutions in a collaborative way rather than pre-empting them. While the exact problem is up to you, it should be exciting and maximise your opportunity for impact.\nAs such, you might want to consider:\n\nWhat are your main departmental/governmental priorities?\nWhich datasets exist, internally and externally?\nWhere do you think new data or tools could deliver most benefits?\nWhich key questions would you like answered in an ideal world?\nWhere do you have most internal expertise - such as practitioners or policy makers - that you could bring together?\n\n\nIf you can, answer these questions in a pre-event workshop. Bring together a core team of analysts and practitioners and ask what data is available, what they wish was available, and what questions they’ve always wanted to tackle. Hackathons are opportunities to expose your senior leaders to the art of the possible and try new things, so don’t be afraid to aim high.\n\nMost importantly, make sure the key question and challenge is new and exciting - if your analysts are just repeating tasks they’ve been asked to do in their day job, it’s not a hackathon!\nYour challenge will define your event, so make sure it’s something you believe in, and use it to guide what comes next. Is it a highly technical challenge in a well understood field, or a broader ask in a niche policy area? It might need different participants, different judges, different facilities or different data, but they should be informed by your key challenge."

    "text": "Identifying Participants and Datasets\n\nWithin or Cross Department?\nHackathons will likely deliver maximum impact by bringing together as diverse a range of participants with previously unseen data. Cross-government events will encourage broad participation, likely bringing in new methods and expertise, but this must be balanced with data security considerations.\nAs such, this should be decided early on in collaboration with the primary departmental partner, while giving consideration to the range of participants, available planning time, and data sets most likely to generate value.\n\n\nParticipants\nA successful hackathon is dependent on a broad range of participants, with a balanced mix of domain knowledge and technical expertise - in effect, a balance between coders/data-scientists, policy staff who understand the broader strategic challenge, and “coal face” expertise who understand how the data is generated and used and what will deliver impact on the front-line.\nIf you can run a pre-hackathon workshop, you have a great opportunity to identify potential participants: think about other experts who may have a stake in your data, or may be involved in its creation or use.\nDepending on the topic and data sensitivity, you could even reach out to partners outside government - are there interested academics, private sectors organisations or non-governmental organisations who have expertise and a stake in your problem? Now is a great opportunity to bring them into the room and see what data they can bring to bear on our problems."

The whole point of hackathons is to bring diverse people into a room, so make sure you tune your communications to achieve that!\nIf you do put together any nifty graphics, consider how you can use them to generate some excitement on the day! Posters, signs, fancy illustrations - you’re aiming to create a physical space that communicates the just important your challenge is, so make sure you think about how you produce those well in advanced (as well as any other swag you might want to offer out!)\n\n\n\nNifty graphics don’t have to cost the world (from Police Rewired)\n\n\nNifty graphics don’t have to cost the world (from Police Rewired)\nUnless your hackathon is completely internal to your department, think about your public presence… how are people going to be invited to the event? Consider a public facing web-page, or at an easily available FAQ with basic details about what a hackathon is and what you’re hoping to achieve.\nOnce you have a well designed public presence, think about where and how you can communicate it - who are you trying to reach, and how can you appeal to as many of them as possible? Consider cross-government communities and networks, such as the Gov Data Science Slack or reaching out through appropriate civil service professions."

The key question is what data can you provide, and how useful will it be?\nConsider pre-preparing your data - nobody wants to spend the first 12 hours figuring out which of a hundred columns is most useful!\n\n\nManaging Information Risk\nIf using identifiable or sensitive data, you should secure a commitment in principle with senior Data Protection officers as soon as feasible.\nThe exact steps you take to secure your information will be informed by your theme, your department, and the datasets you are working with, but could include:\n\nLimiting the event to vetted department staff\nEnsuring the data is deleted at the conclusion of the event\nWorking on a specific secure analytical environment (either physical or secure cloud)\n\nDepending on your department and topic area, you will have different obligations around how to manage your legal obligations and information risk. These will likely include consideration of a Data Protection Impact Assessment, but may include other department specific policies.\nAny data risks should be heavily mitigated by the contained nature of your hackathon, and your senior champion should be able to support you in minimising the work in completing these processes, while still managing any risks.\nFor cross-government events, a collaborative approach should be agreed between Data Protection Officers - for example, this could include:\n\nA joint statement from all DPOs covering the event\nA central DPIA for the hosting department, with bespoke additional DPIAs created for additional departments providing data using their processes.\n\nIf you’re struggling to complete your DPIA, don’t be ask to reach out for help!

    "section": "Tooling",
    "text": "Tooling\nThe exact nature of your tooling will depend on what is available internally, and the sensitivity of your data. At a minimum, this should provide collaborative access to open-source, reproducible analytical tools (such as R and/or Python) in line with government analytics guidance, either locally or in the cloud.\nIf such tooling is not available internally, you may be able to seek support for a temporary solution through your internal technical team or 10DS.\nThere is no perfect answer to the tooling question, so be prepared for a open discussion with your technical and data protection teams, and reach a healthy compromise between data security and maximising the opportunities of collaboration.\n\nDo none of these options work for you? We can help! No solution is always perfect, but we’ll do our best to offer advice and connect you to other who have made it work across government\n\n\nCloud\nWhere possible, hackathons should use an existing internal analytical environment that enables collaborative coding (for example, the MoJ Analytical platform) to reduce any concerns around data sharing.\nIf such a platform does not exist, you may be able to spin-up a temporary, pre-packaged solution in your government secure cloud - this will vary based on your infrastructure, but as a minimum this could be a managed cloud analytical notebook, such as Amazon Sagemaker, Google Collaboratory and Azure Databricks, or an instance of RStudio Cloud or JupyterHub\nIf none of these options are feasible, you may wish to consider existing cross-government cloud analytics solutions, either obtaining guest access to existing analytical platforms where this is possible (such as MOJ or BEIS), or looking at cross-government offerings such as the ONS Integrated Data Solution or the Home Office ACE Vivace platform.\n\n\nPhysical\nWhere a cloud solution is not feasible, you may wish to consider a “local” solution. At it’s most basic, this could involve installing Anaconda or R Studio on secure laptops provided for the event, but depending on local availability, you may be able to build a more sophisticated local analytics environment - for example, by hosting notebooks through JupyterHub and version control through GitLab on a local server.\n\n\nCollaboration and Social Tools\nThe point of a hackathon is to collaborate and show off your work, so make sure you have digital tools to do just that.\nFor your participants, that should include a chatroom/collaboration space. While this is normally Slack or Teams, there are plenty of other more unique options, such as Gather.Town. You may wish to also provide a central location to store key documents, such as Dropbox or Notion, as well as a version controlled code repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.\nIt’s also a good time to consider how you’re going to share and publise your progress more widely - consider live-streaming your keynote speeches, or providing a Twitter hashtag!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe less time your participants spend confused, the more time they can spend tackling problems, so use your tools to make their life as easy as possible! From time-tables to data catalogues, research papers and contact points, equip your participants as best they can to make an impact"

However, there are key pieces of equipment you can provide (beyond the physical location) to enable collaboration and participation.\n\nWhiteboard / Flipcharts: ideally provided during ideation sessions and during team deep-work, these help encourage discussion and visualising prototypes\nPost-it-notes (with colours!)\nDisplays: Large (eg, television sized) displays to encourage teams to show off their work to each other and senior stakeholders - these can either be fixed (eg, in the team work space) or mobile"

Use whatever solution is available (eg, Eventbrite or Quill) to maximise participation while ensuring event security and capacity.\nYou should try and understand the mix of technical skills available in your audience - this will vary based on the your policy area, but we’ve previously tried to ensure at least two thirds of participants are technical (eg, data scientists or developers). This can be done at the ticketing stage by limiting tickets by type (eg, hacker vs practitioner) or afterwards using surveys, and you may wish to understand your participants level of technical knowledge, and particular areas of expertise or policy interest.\n\n(Optional) Team Formation\nDepending on time-scales, you may wish to start constructing teams after ticketing, but before the event has begun, to maximise coding time - however, this runs the risk of forcing participants into a project they would not otherwise choose, and limiting the collaborative benefits of “ideation” (though these will be limited if your event is not cross-department).\nKeep teams small and nimble by following the two-pizza teams rule! We’ve found that large teams can struggle to focus on delivering something nimble, so don’t be afraid to break them up - these are teams, not comittees!\nIf you do pre-organise your teams, consider a pre-event survey to ascertain participant’s primary analytical tool (eg, R or Python), level of experience, area of expertise (eg, geospatial, NLP) to try and engineer well balanced, productive teams, using a tool such as Google Forms or Microsoft Forms."

We’d recommend a diverse, senior panel that can understand the technical challenges your participants have overcome, as well as what it might be able to achieve in the wider context… for example, here is a good example of a three person panel:\n\nA senior strategic leader: A minister/commissioner/permanent secretary, who might not understand the technical aspects of your solution, but can understand just how much impact it might have on their sticky, “wicked” problems they haven’t been able to solve internally\nA senior technical champion: Someone with a grip on the technical challenges, and just how your solution addresses them - for example, a Head of Data Science/infrastructure\nAn external guest: An inspiring external guest with domain knowledge or an understanding of the challenges the sector faces can add some useful diversity and context - for instance, this might be a senior representative from a private sector partner, or a charity working on the problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nExcellent judges can make or break a hackathon, so take care of your panel! You should have a panel of eminent, inspirational experts that will wow and inspire, have the technical chops to challenge your participants and the strategic vision to know which nascent prototype will grow a product that drives large scale change. Pick them wisely, and make sure your participants know just how lucky they are to have them.\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying Winners\nOnce your event is over, it’s time to crown some champion(s)! Each team should be given an opportunity to present their work, ideally to a panel of your senior champion in a “dragon’s den” format. We’ve found short, impactive demo presentations (eg, limited to 3-5 minutes) followed by questions to be a good balance, but this will depend on the nature of your event… if you’ve gone very large, you may want to use a digital solution like Gavel.\nBe very strict with time for presentations and set people up to start the next presentation quickly.\nIt is likely you’ll get a range of outputs, from feasible MVPs to rough wireframe concepts - that’s fine! The point of a hackathon is to explore potential solutions, not build finished products, so make sure participants don’t leave dispirited or compare themselves too harshly. As such, you may want to consider a broad range of prize “categories” (eg, most impactive, most novel, best use of X), rather than being incredibly competitive. We’ve found a good fit is to have a showstopper “Grand Prize”, a winner per main “challenge” (eg, best way of tackling X, best visualisation), and a whole host of honourable mentions.\nIf you can, consider whether you can offer some unique and meaningful (and cheap!) prizes."
