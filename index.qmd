Evidence House is a Downing Street-led initiative, working with collaborators including ONS Data Science Campus, Evaluation Task Force, Modernisation and Reform Unit, Go Science and National Situation Centre. It aims to crowdsource, research, develop and deliver solutions to wicked cross-cutting problems in government, through thorough problem profiling, exploration and data mining, getting to the evidence-informed heart of issues.
